# another one leaves
as jesus and jon were beginning to think about starting a purely vocals and drums duo, jon duelfer seems to have left chapel hill

just as no one knows where the h in his name has gone, jon's location is currently unknown

rumors are that he fell in love with a spaniard and has left for the iberian peninsula

some people claim to still be able to hear his laughter
