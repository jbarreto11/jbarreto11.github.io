# our story
mr. fred started off as any other college band - one random dude happened to know three other random dudes and then they named their band after a completely different random dude

the real mr. fred is a lovable security guard - he has never listened to the fake mr. fred but we like to think that he would like the fake mr. fred

we dont know what type of music we play, but its rocky rock

# the band
vocals, salsa dancing, lip-syncing - jesus barreto

drums, looking like john snow, laughing at things that arent funny - jon duelfer

guitar, saying whats up dude, other things - william parker

bass, guitar, keyboard, production, weird facial hair - benjamin "nappy burfday" sutherland
