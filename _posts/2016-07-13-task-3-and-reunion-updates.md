this blog post is about two ways i have failed to do what i probably should have done this week

for my info science class, i was meant to convert a file to different formats (html, docx, odt, pdf) using fancy tech. i wanted to use some of my cool research papers and stuff but it got really difficult so i chose to just use a lame markdown file i created

this markdown file highlights the second failure i was talking about - not texting ben back aka once again prolonging the long-awaited mr. fred reunion

## either way

i completed the assignment by creating a script that automatically converted the mardown file i made to an html, docx, odt, and pdf file by utilizing the command pandoc -o $file.(what i wanted to convert to) $file.md

i ran the script and it worked and here is a link to the repository with the files : https://github.com/jbarreto11/task-3-convert-documents
